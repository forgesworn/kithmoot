/**
 * Display names.

 * key types whatever they like, and nothing anywhere checks it. That is the
 * point - joining a room should cost a name and nothing else - but it means
 * a name is attacker-controlled text arriving off a relay, and every reader
 * has to treat it as such.
 *
 * Two rules follow, and they live in different places:
 *
 *   1. **Sanitise it.** Everything below. A name may not carry characters
 *      that let it take a second row, hide part of itself, or reverse the
 *      direction the rest of the line renders in, and it may not be long
 *      enough to push everything else off the row.
 *
 *   2. **Never render it alone, and never as HTML.** Both are the caller's
 *      job, because both are about what a name sits next to. A short pubkey
 *      always renders beside it, so two people called "Darren" stay
 *      distinguishable and an impersonation is visible; and it goes in via
 *      `textContent`, never `innerHTML`, so markup in a name stays text.

 * friends) making the rest of the line render backwards, a zero-width
 * space hiding the difference between two names, a byte-order mark padding
 * one invisibly. Naming the class rather than listing the code points is
 * deliberate: the list grows with Unicode, and a filter that has to be
 * updated to stay correct is a filter that will one day be out of date.
 *
 * It also removes U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER, so a joined emoji sequence
 * comes apart into its parts. That is a real cost, accepted knowingly: an
 * invisible character that changes what a name looks like is exactly the
 * thing being removed, and there is no way to keep one and not the other.
